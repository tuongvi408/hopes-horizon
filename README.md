### **Core Metrics**:
1. **Trust**: Represents the public’s opinion of the player. High trust is essential for **election/re-election** (President), **community support** (Governor), and a **strong reputation** (Businessman). Trust is directly influenced by decisions that affect the public good.
   - **Increases**: With decisions that benefit society (e.g., social welfare, job creation).
   - **Decreases**: With decisions that prioritize personal gain over public interest (e.g., neglecting infrastructure, ignoring public welfare).

2. **Wealth**: A combined measure of **national wealth** (for President/Governor) and **personal wealth** (for Businessman). Wealth is the primary resource for funding policies, investments, and personal endeavors.
   - **Increases**: With profitable decisions (e.g., tax cuts, business investments, military spending).
   - **Decreases**: With costly decisions (e.g., social welfare programs, international aid, environmental protection efforts).

3. **Happiness**: Represents the public’s overall well-being. Happiness is critical for public support and the success of the player's leadership. Low happiness leads to **decreased trust** and potential failure.
   - **Increases**: When policies improve the lives of the population (e.g., healthcare, education, fair wages).
   - **Decreases**: When decisions negatively impact public welfare (e.g., tax increases, business prioritization over social needs).

### **Game Mechanics**:

#### **Game Flow**:
1. **Role Selection**: The player selects one of three roles: **President**, **Governor**, or **Businessman**.
2. **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Each **turn** represents **6 months**. The player makes **one decision per turn** that affects the country's economy, the public's happiness, and their personal wealth.
3. **Scenario System**: After each turn, the player is presented with a **randomized scenario** based on their role, which includes different decisions that influence the core metrics (**Trust**, **Wealth**, **Happiness**).
4. **Decision Impact**: The decisions made by the player will directly impact the three core metrics. For example, the President may choose to increase military spending, which will increase **Wealth** but decrease **Happiness**.
5. **Game End**: After **8 turns** (4 years), the game ends. Players are evaluated based on the state of their metrics and whether they met their goals:
   - **President**: Re-election or legacy success.
   - **Governor**: Local popularity and potential presidential run.
   - **Businessman**: Personal wealth and social responsibility balance.

#### **Metric Interactions**:
- **Trust ↔ Happiness**: Low trust leads to low happiness, and vice versa.
- **Wealth ↔ Happiness**: Wealth affects happiness, but if wealth is gained at the expense of public well-being, happiness will decrease.
- **Wealth ↔ Trust**: Wealth generation (e.g., through taxes, investments, or business growth) can improve trust, especially if the wealth benefits the population.
